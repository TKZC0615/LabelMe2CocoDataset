This script was intended to convert images labeled with labelme tool (https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) to some format that Detectron (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) can understand. Among others detectron understands http://cocodataset.org format. The input images are stored as json files produced by labelme. Json files are stored in ./input/DATASET_NAME folder. Then DATASET_NAME is provided as main param to the convert.py script. If everything works correct you can expect output in ./output/DATASET_NAME folder. Contents of this folder should be compatible with COCODataset.
